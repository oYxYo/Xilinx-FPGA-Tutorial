1. accurate power calculation at an early stage in the design cycle will result in fewer problems.
2. the Xilinx Power Estimator Spreadsheet can be used for estimating the power consumption and the junction temperature of all Xilinx FPGAs.
3. importing activity rate information makes the dynamic power estimate more accurate.
4. Xilinx Power Estimator Spreadsheet can be used for what-if analysis
